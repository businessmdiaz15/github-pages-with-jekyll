<span style="font-size: large;">▪ About Me ▪&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
I graduated from Georgia State University with a bachelor’s degree in the Art of Philosophy with a concentration in Pre-law. I am married and have 3 cats, one of which we acquired on accident— so to speak. While I would say I am a Georgia native, I was born in El Salvador. My family and I have been here since 2001. Though I now consider English my native language, I retained my ability to speak, read, and write Spanish.<br />

<br />
I have spent my professional and academic careers developing my ability to communicate effectively and leverage the power of communication in multiple levels of business operations. From the boots-on-the-ground sales and customer support, to creating, developing, and presenting remote learning seminars and providing feedback to product teams, I have been involved in most aspects of the customer experience.<br />
<br />
On my off time, I like to work with computers. I build, learn about, and troubleshoot computer hardware.<br />
<br />
I assist people in my community resolve common computer software issues and educate them about alternatives to buying a new computer to resolve common hardware problems, which sometimes even improve the performance of their existing systems. Computers are like cars; everyone should know how to service their own.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your consideration. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I am always happy to help!<br />
